# Clip-a-roo source code

This repository contains the source code for Clip-a-roo, a text snippet manager application built with Nuxt 4. It is a little client-side app that stores your frequently used text snippets inside your browser's localStorage, and therefore works offline/locally.

You can access a hosted version of Clip-a-roo from [https://cliparoo.blurrybit.com](https://cliparoo.blurrybit.com), or if you prefer to self-host, you can clone the repository and run it yourself.

Currently, Clip-a-roo is in early development, so expect bugs and missing features. If you find any issues or have feature requests, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
